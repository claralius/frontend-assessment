## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/claralius/frontend-assessment.git

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
    ```bash
      cd your-repo-name

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install

## Running the Project
To run the project: **npm run dev**

## Assumptions
These are several assumptions and details that I have made when doing this project:
- The refresh button is currently a placeholder and does not have functionality yet.
- Navigating back from the results page to the tutorials will restart the tutorial from the beginning.
- The project focuses on responsiveness for mobile and desktop screens, with media queries implemented for optimal viewing.
- Responsiveness works best down to a minimum screen width of 330 pixels.
- It is assumed that the tutorial walkthrough cannot be looped.
- An example of the implementation of Lenis and GSAP have been integrated on the homepage for smoother animations.
- Lottie animations have been implemented in both the multistep form and results page.
